    <h4>We both absoloutly love reading. Here are just a few of our favourite books.</h4>

      <h2>Harry Potter Series</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>The Harry Potter Series is all about a boy wizard, and his life growing up.
            He meets a multitude of weird and wounderful people, such as Ron Weasley, Hermionie Granger, Draco Malfoy, and Luna Lovegood.
            But Harry is no ordinary wizard. He is the chosen one (also known as <em>The Boy who Lived</em>)
            He is the wizard who must save the world from the evil Lord Voldemort.
          <p>
            We both adore these books, especially <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>.
            We love the fantasy genre, and J.K.Rowling is an amazing author. She encompases the genre beautifully, and really sucks you into her world.
            <p>
              We rate these books 10 out of 10.It is a must read for all ages!
        <h2>Maze Runner Series</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>The Maze Runner Series is another that we love. It is about a boy called Thomas, who wakes up in the middle of a maze, having no idea who he is or how he got there.
