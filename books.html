  <h1>Books</h1>
  <p>
    <h4>We both absoloutly love reading. Here are just a few of our favourite books.</h4>
    <p>
      <h2>Harry Potter Series</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>The Harry Potter Series is all about a boy wizard, and his life growing up.
            He meets a multitude of weird and wounderful people, such as Ron Weasley, Hermionie Granger, Draco Malfoy, and Luna Lovegood.
            But Harry is no ordinary wizard. He is the chosen one (also known as <em>The Boy who Lived</em>)
            He is the wizard who must save the world from the evil Lord Voldemort.
          <p>
            We both adore these books, especially <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>.
            We love the fantasy genre, and J.K.Rowling is an amazing author. She encompases the genre beautifully, and really sucks you into her world.
            <p>
              We rate these books 10 out of 10.It is a must read for all ages!
      <h2>Maze Runner Series</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>The Maze Runner Series is another that we love. It is about a boy called Thomas, who wakes up in the middle of a maze, having no idea who he is or how he got there.
            We follow him throught his journey to work out who he is, and why ended up where he did.
          <p>
            Just like with Harry Potter, the Maze Runner is a series of books that we both enjoy.
            It is an inivative new take on the dystopian genre, and is a great use of time.
            <p>
              We rate this book series 8 out of 10.
      <h2>Book Thief</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>The Book Thief is a book that Manraj loves. It is all about a girl named Liesel, living in Nazi Germany, who is hiding a Jew named Max in her basement.
            They have to survive the trials and tribulations of being alive in that time.
            <p>
              This is one of Manraj's favourite books. Hannah hasnt read it yet, but is keen to based off of what revews it has had.
              It is a real tearjerking novel about war and friendship.
              <p>
                We rate this book 8.5 out of 10.
      <h2>The Rest of us Just Live Here</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>The Rest of us Just Live Here is a book by Hannah's favourite author Patrick Ness.
            It is all about a boy named Mikey, who is surviving in a dystopian world.
            Unlike many books from this genre, Mikey is not the <em>chosen one</em>, and instead is just trying to get by without his school blowing up... again.
            <p>
              This is one of Hannah's favourite books. It is really inivative and different from anything she has ever read.
              <p>
                We rate this book 8 out of 10.
