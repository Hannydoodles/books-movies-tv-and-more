        <h2>The Hunger Games Series</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>The Hunger Games is about a dystopian future where one boy and one girl in every district (there are twelve in total) get chosen as tributes to compete in the Hunger Games.
              The actual games are played every year and in them the tributes have to fight ot the death.
              One year a girl called Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sisters place in the games and we follow her story as she fights for survival.
            <p>
              We both adore the four Hunger Games movies
