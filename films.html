        <h2>The Hunger Games Series</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>The Hunger Games is about a dystopian future where one boy and one girl in every district (there are twelve in total) get chosen as tributes to compete in the Hunger Games.
              The actual games are played every year and in them the tributes have to fight ot the death.
              One year a girl called Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sisters place in the games and we follow her story as she fights for survival.
            <p>
              We both adore the four Hunger Games movies and its a great way to spend your entire day inside watching TV.
              It is also based on a book so you can read that as well.
              <p>
                Hannah and I have agreed to rate this a 7 out of 10.

        <h2>Disney Movies</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>All Disney movies are by far the best films ever and if you have never watched one or never heard of Disney you need to crawl out of the rock you are living under and watch one.
              Hannah's favourite Disney movie is <em>Hercules</em> and Manraj's is <em>The Lion King</em>.
            <p>
              We rate Disney movies a 10 out of 10.

        <h2>Divergent Series</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>Divergent is about a future where everybody is seperated into four factions called Amity, Dauntless, Erudite, Candor and Abnigation.
              Each faction has a personality trait that is unique to the others.
              Divergent is about a girl called Tris Prior who is a divergent (someone who belongs to more than one faction) and this is about her hiding her real identity from the government.
            <p>
              We both find the first movie in this series interesting but the secound movie is a bit boring but overall the Divergent Series is bearable.
            <p>
              We rate Divergent a 5 out of 10.

        <h2>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>We both love superheroes, and marvel films are by far the best portrayals of superheroes on the big screen.
              Hannah compleatly loves <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> and Manraj's favourite is <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>.
            <p>
              We rate these films 8.5 out of 10.
